## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites for Local Development

- Node.js and npm installed on your system.

### Installation (Local)

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kweinmeister/am-i-covered.git
    cd am-i-covered
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application (Local)

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will typically open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if specified in your Vite configuration).

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploying to Google Cloud Run

Deploying this application to Google Cloud Run is straightforward using the direct-from-source method with Google Cloud Buildpacks.

**Prerequisites for Cloud Run Deployment:**

- Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI) installed and configured.
- A Google Cloud Project with billing enabled.
- Enable the Cloud Run API and Cloud Build API in your Google Cloud Project.
- Ensure your `package.json` has:
  - A `build` script (e.g., `vite build`) that outputs static files to a `dist` directory.
  - A `start` script to serve these files. Example using `serve`: `"start": "serve -s dist -l tcp://0.0.0.0:$PORT"`.
    - If using `serve`, install it: `npm install serve`

**Deployment Command:**

Navigate to your project's root directory and run:

```bash
gcloud run deploy [SERVICE_NAME] \
  --source . \
  --platform managed \
  --region [REGION] \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

- Replace `[SERVICE_NAME]` with your desired service name (e.g., `am-i-covered-service`).
- Replace `[REGION]` with your preferred Google Cloud region (e.g., `us-central1`).
- `--source .` tells Cloud Run to build from the current directory.
- `--allow-unauthenticated` makes your service publicly accessible. Omit this or configure IAM for restricted access.

Google Cloud Build will automatically detect it's a Node.js application, run `npm install` (installing `dependencies` from `package.json`), then `npm run build`, and finally use the `npm start` script to run your application. **You do not need to create a `Dockerfile` or `nginx.conf` for this method.**

For more advanced control over the build process or runtime environment, you can optionally use a `Dockerfile`. Refer to the official Google Cloud Run documentation for Docker-based deployments if needed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
